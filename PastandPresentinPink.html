                The menu of the Fountain Coffee Room at the Beverly
Hills Hotel seems dated at first glance. Cottage cheese;
egg salad sandwich; steak on toast; prune juice; orange
freeze... but there it is, near the bottom of the right hand
corner: “Almond Milk $8.” The diner is covered with
a banana-leaf-print wallpaper, the same wallpaper that
covers the sideboards by the pool cabanas, the entryways
of the bathrooms, the nooks in the lobby, and the length
of the hallways where it power-clashes with the diamond
patterned carpets. The banana leaf is a recurring motif

throughout the hotel, both in its live and illustrated incarnations. Its dominance is only challenged by the pink that

gives the place its adopted name, “The Pink Palace.”<br><br>
                The Beverly Hills Hotel existed before the city itself. Just
as the film industry was taking off, an oil tycoon teamed
up with a socialite and joined directors, producers, actors
and actresses in turning the hills into real estate. Because

of this history, the hotel has found its tune with Hollywood; they continue to exist codependently. The stories

are countless and date back to the 1930s when white

sand was imported to turn the pool into a beach where
the likes of Fred Astaire and Carole Lombard sunned
themselves. Mia Farrow was banned from wearing
pants at the Polo Lounge, where the Rat Pack used to
go on benders and politicos made key Watergate calls.
The hotel’s bungalows have provided both temporary
and long-term homes for generations of stars, housing
Howard Hughes and his bizarre room service requests,
Elizabeth Taylor through two marriages, a custom-made
bed for Marlene Dietrich, Marilyn Monroe in hiding,
and enough affairs for seven of the bungalows to be
known as “Bachelor’s Row.” Katharine Hepburn used to
play tennis on the hotel courts and jump into the pool,
still in her tennis clothes, as soon as she finished a game.<br><br>
                But there are no more tennis games, and no more diving
from high or low. The entire hotel was renovated when it
changed ownership in the 1990s. The courts were paved
over and replaced with new “Presidential Bungalows”
in 2011. The diving boards were taken away. The hotel

and its owner—the Sultan of Brunei—have been boycotted by activists and prominent public figures due to the

Sultan’s stance on gay rights. The past is being entombed

and replaced. Los Angeles is no longer defined by Hollywood, and neither is the hotel. Those with influence have

decided that what used to be a haven, a keeper of secrets,
a mystery, is now just a business.<br><br>
                The building is still pink—not aggressively pink, but a

passive blush. Amongst the assertive buildings of Sunset Boulevard it is relatively subdued, although it sits

elevated above the main road like a monument. Its most
prominent feature is the foliage that surrounds it. The
walls of greenery and the precariously tall palm trees
have grown over time to become a fortress that shrouds
the hotel from the outside world. The green and white
stripes that cover the awning are framed by bright pink

flowers, and gardens of hibiscus and banana plants continue the botanical scene. Wrought-iron balconies placed

next to a massive green panel call out their own age with
their intricate art deco style. “The Beverly Hills,” the
panel reads, with no “hotel.” The Polo Lounge has dark
green booths, each with its own plug-in phone. It has
the feel of a smoky, dark, men’s club: the aura of West
Coast dealmakers miming East Coast mad men. In sharp
contrast with the mood are the flowers and lamps at
each booth. It is obvious that they, along with the lack of
hostility towards women, are a recent addition. No one
picked up a phone. Everyone has their own now.<br><br>
                The former residents are remembered almost as though
they are star athletes at a high school. Photographs of
fan favorites decorate the walls. Cary Grant’s headshot
is hung next to an outfit that he forgot in his bungalow
closet. Grace Kelly and her royal family smile through


their sunglasses. The walls are scattered with portraits of
Marilyn Monroe in a variety of candid moments as banal
as drinking a glass of milk. The Beverly Hills Hotel is
said to be haunted by the spirits of guests past. It seems
as though the ghosts of stars live on through film; like
photographs, their work endures because it is material
and unchanging.<br><br>
                It is ironic that the capture and conservation of the

ephemeral formed the foundation for a place so untamed. Hollywood was the last frontier. There the sun

shone on the American Dream and gave it a final chance
to flourish. Storytellers gave the open land definition

with their words and their pictures and their performances. These pioneers constructed a narrative based

on the absurd: to found a city built of fairy tales. Hollywood became not only a place and an industry, but also

a religion. Its deities had a special intangible quality that

allowed them to captivate audiences on screen. Hollywood became the place to go to find out if you could be

a god.<br><br>
                The Beverly Hills Hotel, like Hollywood itself, was a
child’s dream. Never in New York or Chicago would a
massive pink beacon serve as a monument. For many

years it was a mirror of Hollywood itself: full of contradictions: at once outrageously popular, insulated from

the outside world, and a stage for the performance of
lives. Those who were canonized in its hallowed halls
were frozen in a character constructed by others for
them; their public images were another script, with no
opportunity for a cut. The stars were bound not only by
the interactions amongst themselves but by their places
in an entity bound by vision and creativity—Hollywood.
They were differentiated from society at large not only
by their lifestyle and the nature of their work but by the

isolation that is an inherent part of the role that designation requires them to play. The hotel served as an escape

from the perpetual narratives of their lives: a trapdoor to
a place of total novelty and freedom. The bungalows of
the stars were like a colony for the independent: people
being alone together. It was an opportunity for a royal to
shrug off his or her robe and be the little person that was
inside.<br><br>
                The age of Hollywood as a state of mind is over. No longer do we idolize celebrities. We elevate them and revere

them, but we want them to be “just like us.” The public
has no desire for mystery or imagination. We demand the
unvarnished truth about our celebrities’ lives. We want to
see unlimited banality. Marilyn Monroe drinking milk is

not enough. How can films remain a tonic for the imagination, an escape from reality, an opportunity to be lifted

out of our ordinary lives into something greater if we are
watching our best friends on screen?<br><br>
                The Beverly Hills Hotel is no longer a castle. Its royalty
have been dethroned, its kingdom devalued. It is still for
the rich and famous but now in a soulless way. The walls

have grown heavy with the idea and reality of the sparseness of drama, the trappings of real estate development

and its sprawl, the pretense and takeover by those trying
to prove their wealth, and the sell-out that is the luxury
hotel operator.<br><br>
                However powerful these forces may be, they cannot completely eclipse a place loaded with emotions and brimming

with memories. The joy, sadness, arguments and laughter
of those that came before all settle into the bones of the
place. The Beverly Hills Hotel still holds a glimmer of
something magical. The hotel, as with all of Los Angeles,

still holds in the air the hope for a last shot at the American Dream. That magical feeling doesn’t have a name.

That’s the point. It cannot be conveyed through words. It
can only be conveyed through film.<br><br>
                
                On a post out front—overshadowed by the red carpet that
serves as an entryway, blocked by one of the ubiquitous
banana plants, hidden behind gold bellman’s carts—is an
inscription that reads, “Vayan Con Dios.” “Go With God.”<br><br><br>
