                during third grade</span><br><br><span id="italic">My velcro sneakers glitter when they touch the pavement. I look down
                so that I can see them flicker. Sunlight stings the nape of my neck. An
                earthy smudge on my left shoe comes to my attention and now I’m
                struggling to forgive the duck-voiced upperclassman who scuffed it at
                recess. Eyes glazed, I tread on a sidewalk that moves with the monotony
                of a conveyor belt. But then I see the clouds on the concrete—cease
                my brooding to watch them float inside a glassy pool of leftover rain.
                Sunlight floods my pupils as I direct my gaze towards the sky where the
                same clouds glide overhead.<br><br>
                All at once, I grow conscious of my state of in-betweenness, this
                disorienting suspension between the clouds. The conveyor belt beneath
                me now moves so fast it has become a blur, and my legs burn bad but
                I’m pressed to reach home and bury these hot tears in stuffed animals.
                I wake up exhausted from that unexpected encounter with reflection,
                illusion, and reality. To my relief the sky has waxed into a spotless violet
                tone. But the persistent uneasiness lingers. I know the clouds will come
                back tomorrow, and with their return, the obligation to find my place
                between them.</span><br><br>

                This is my earliest encounter with the discomfort of
                acquiring knowledge. With shock and horror I realized
                both the cryptic vastness of the world, as well as my own
                liminal place within it. I have no choice but to subsist in
                the awkward crevice between the endlessness of knowledge
                and my own limited capacity for it. To receive something
                without asking—something like knowledge—teeters
                precariously between a status of burden and gift.<br><br>

                2018 Chinese New Year</span><br><br><span id="italic">I can cast a desire. All it takes is a coin tied to red wishing paper and

                tossed into a wishing tree. My friends choose their desires from a laminated list of wish options: Elimination of Difficulties, Good Health

                For the Family, or Good Luck All Around. I scan, scroll, select No. 22:
                Ocean of Wisdom.<br><br>
                                Icy sheets of rain sweep over the courtyard crowded with stuffed coats.
                Marbled clouds hover in dark blue while my breaths reel in and out
                mistily, like a tide. I bunch the paper in tight folds around the coin —
                so as to approximate the thing as aerodynamic. I wind back my arm to

                send my hope for an Ocean of Wisdom sailing into the branches. Mid-throw, some twisted pang of conflict seizes my chest cavity, crunching

                my lungs. A familiar queasy gush floods my throbbing temples as I
                process the absurdity of this scenario.</span><br><br>

                                I wish for an ocean of wisdom in a world where less than
                5% of the ocean has been explored to date. Yet still I toil
                in the >5% as I cling to my raft of intellect before waves so

                titanic that the whole ordeal seems comically pitiful: a semi-empowered, yet mostly intimidated, ragdoll at the mercy

                of epistemological riptides. The ocean may be colossal or
                familiar and dangerous or nurturing, but remains always
                ungraspable by nature.<br><br>
                
                <span id="interview">Crystal Cove beach
                in the early 2000s</span><br><br><span id="italic">There are no crystals and there is no cove but there is the beach. I
                sit on the shore, facing the sea. The water stumbles over itself before
                unraveling in a shallow foam spread at my feet. The salt makes a
                fizzing soda sound and toes curl in visceral pleasure. Beside me sits
                the sandcastle Papa helped me build, a plastic hand rake, and the big
                blue bucket my sister and I use to catch sand crabs, assign them names,
                families, and backstories. In the tidepools there are anemones. I stopped
                poking them after Maman said it might hurt them.<br><br>
                                                My hand flexes into a fistful of sand with the coming wave. No trace
                of sandcrabs, I fixate my gaze on the sand that dribbles from my caged
                fist. I tighten my clutch around the sand. I cannot contain it. A dense
                stream hisses as it escapes. In desperate force, I clench my hand tighter.
                My fist shrinks and shrinks until the sand seeps away altogether and my
                curled knuckles press the palm of my hand.</span><br><br>

                                                Petty pride and brute willpower were weak fuel for
                my frantic race to retain all knowledge. Like sand, the
                tighter the grip, the harder it is to grasp. It makes for a
                profoundly perplexing experience to exist in a body that
                does not fully understand what a body is, with a mind
                that cannot comprehend itself. The brain itself is always
                suspended, sloshing around in head juice (cerebrospinal
                fluid). Nonetheless, the bits of knowledge I do feed this
                obscure organ inform how I digest the world. How I digest
                the world affects how I subsist and act within it. So what
                I know or don’t know, then, it is an extension of who I
                am. My very being interconnects with my spectrum of
                knowledge. Without infinite knowledge, am I perpetually
                incomplete?<br><br>
                
                <span id="interview">Springtime in
                Brookside Park</span><br><br><span id="italic">My little sister and I tire of the monkey bars. We rest our arms limply
                as we lie on the overgrown grass. I bend my elbows and cup my hands
                behind my head like I see people do in movies. Sophie lets her feet
                flop to either side, palms up, blissfully unaware of her appearance. I
                recognize the fragile parts of her—still untainted by expectations. I
                have to look away from her and toward those clouds again.<br><br>
                                                                I squint at the sky and ascribe each cloud to a sea creature: seahorse,
                whale, turtle, no..not turtle... more like stingray. Definitely stingray.
                I might be a marine biologist when I grow up. Sophie squints at the
                sky too. They look like a whole bunch of spider webs all tangled up, she
                says. She’s been learning about arachnids with Mrs. Kelly. But spider
                webs? I frown at her, then the clouds. I picture extremely dense clusters
                of millions of thin silky threads. Alright, I guess I see it.</span><br><br>

                                                                Whereas it had always been obvious to me that experience
                affects my thought, cloud watching revealed the inverse:
                what I think about affects my interpretation of the world
                around me. In this way, access to different knowledge grants
                access to realities apart from my own. I had mistakenly
                taken the pursuit of knowledge to be a solitary endeavor, an
                articulation of self-containment and cultivation. All along, I
                had overlooked the beauty in exchange. Quiet observation
                and genuine conversation help me peer into another reality,
                so to speak—this is the optimal proximate to living it. This
                is the closest I can get to realities other than my own, to
                partake in and perhaps alter it with what I bring from my
                own reality, and maybe let my reality be altered in return.<br><br>
                
                <span id="interview">Southern Californian
                Summertime</span><br><br><span id="italic">I swim alone on a hot day. School playgrounds sit empty and blacktops
                smoke in the searing heat. I ease into the water, weightless, watching
                the plastic umbilical cord of the pool vacuum sputter beneath me.
                I drift down and look out of the transparent, mobile veil of water
                between the world and me. I watch the clouds again. This time they
                warp with watery viscosity.<br><br>
                My world here is noiseless and warm—maybe I can stay a little longer.
                I think of the day my shoes got scuffed. I think about how this time, I’m
                inside the puddle. I’ve slipped under the clouds—the entities and the
                reflections. I have at last found a place in the world I am not confined,
                where I can move freely between all substances. I may not braving an
                Ocean of Wisdom, but I am content in this pool. My breath interrupts
                my thoughts and demands air. I shatter the surface with a gasp,
                my cheeks flush with quiet awe. With each passing breath, I slowly
                succumb to a humble peace of unknowing and claim completeness
                nonetheless.<br><br></span>
