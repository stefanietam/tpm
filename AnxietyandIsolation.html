            <div class="story">My hope with this piece is to create a series of
disjointed vignettes using fragments of journal
entries that detail the very real, but often ignored,
anxiety and isolation I’ve experienced since moving
to Los Angeles. My goal is to write with complete
sincerity in order to face these emotions head-on.
This piece is both self-serving and communal;
I hope that my attempt at facing these dark, murky
emotions can provide some sort of internal coping
while simultaneously acting as a relatable, shared
experience.<br><br><span id="interview">ONE: 7/27/17</span><br>

Every morning, I wake up sweating through my bedsheets
in the claustrophobic LA heat listening to the sound of
my roommate ritualistically torching his dab rig in the
living room. I can’t help picturing myself in a Los Angeles
dystopia, an Orwellian nightmare that’s clawing its gnarled
hands out of the recesses of my imagination. As I brush

my teeth, I envision jagged skyscrapers piercing the smog-
filled sky in all their drab neon majesty, royal kings and

princely knights of a hellish landscape. Sheltered below
these towering monoliths, seedy back-alleys squeeze
together grimy, sweating bodies worming their way to the
next source of entertainment, like laboratory rats scurrying
through a maze, addicted to the short-lived euphoric thrill
of the drugs that lay in wait at the end.
<br><br>There’s something so attractive about misery.
Nothing can compare to those cathartic
rushes of depressing thoughts
and heartaches listening
as the silence in the
dark, musty
room comes
alive—breathing,
buzzing, and
whispering the
dejected murmurs
of the loners of
the world. It’s why
I take great solace
in conjuring up these
fantastical nightmares of
mine. They present me with
a convenient little pill of
misery every morning, which
I greedily take with shaking
hands.<br><br>

For some unknown, horribly naïve reason, I’ve always
carried a heartfelt longing for a profound sadness,
wishing for a tragic origin story. My daydreams as a child
consisted of phantasmal visions of my parents dying in an
inexplicable accident or visions that I’ve contracted a deadly
disease with no more than six months to live. My fantasies
today are much more elaborate and indulgent. I lay out all
the details of my funeral, from the quirky exequies to the
flowers to the music accompanying the funeral procession.
I cherish every trip to these imaginary lives of mine,
sinking into the bliss of self-pity and the
euphoric release of control.
What I secretly crave for in
these fantasies is an excuse to
stop trying, to relinquish all
responsibility, to be able to
waste away. Somehow I
find a tragic origin story
more comforting than
knowing the chemicals
in my brain are all
screwed up and
my synapses are
snapping and
splintering into
a desiccated
pile of sensory
ooze. At least
then I can justify
these black thoughts
swimming in my head like a
fish helplessly circling around in its
shit-filled bowl, praying for death.<br><br><span id="interview">TWO: 1/7/18</span><br>
<br>
I’m sitting cross-legged on the hardwood boards at the
Hammer Museum, glancing at the whirlwind of event
preparations swirling around me. I think what drives most
people to LA is the endless virility of the city, but for me, LA

has become a torrential onslaught of lifeless events, a flick-
ering of forgettable places and fading faces, a whirlwind of

ephemeral ecstasy. I’ve become disillusioned with this false
image of the LA lifestyle. It seems as if the value of one’s life
here is solely determined by the sheer quantity of events you
go to rather than the actual experiences themselves. It’s all
a flashy display of peacock feathers–each person eager to
prove that they are having more fun than the rest. On too
many occasions, I’ve fallen under that same trap, rushing
out of my apartment with the hope that the events will
somehow manifest themselves into a better, more
complete version of myself, but I end up just

equally as empty and shallow at a con-
cert as I do when I stay home

dissolving my brain with
YouTube clips of

hippos fight-
ing crocodiles.
<br><br>
A few feet past

the event prepa-
rations, shrieks

of delight ring out

from the kids twist-
ing and swirling away

on the spinning circu-
lar chairs that dot the

Hammer Museum pavil-
ion. Everyone loves these

chairs for their novelty, but
I loathe them. They sit there
crooked and mischievous,
beckoning the rider to take a short
and pleasant spin. But all they remind me of
is the tumultuous, nauseating ride through the turbid,
river-rapids of depression where the insidious knots in my
stomach constrict the very life out of me until I can do
nothing but try not to puke. I hate those chairs because they
offer a false hope of an escape. “All you have to do is stand
up and everything will be fine” they maliciously snicker.
I’ve heard that mantra before: “Just snap out of it, Max.
You’re being too sensitive.” I wish it was that simple. Every
morning, I have to wake up to the reverberating roar of that
despicable river and take a deep breath before plunging into

the emotionally draining whirlpool, like a ragdoll without a
safety line.<br><br>
It’s oppressively hot in LA like it is every single day. I can
feel myself sweating through my black Levis, the sweat
like hot liquid ooze dripping onto the black tar pavement.
It’s all too much. The black tar, the black stench, the black
coffee, the black bowl of the bong, the black outfits. My
mom insists that I should be proud of my jet-black hair, but
it just reminds me of the black thoughts crowding my
head. My black hair is growing proportional to
how shitty I feel in this city, like I’m
living in a pitiful Pinocchio
comedy where the more I feel
the gut-gnawing anxiety, the
longer my hair grows. The
funny thing is that I’ve
been carefully cultivating
my hair just like I’ve
carefully cultivated this
bleak outlook on life.
It seems as if I’ve

somehow roman-
ticized depression

and sadness to
a point where
I’ve actually
tricked myself
into feeling this
way, like a Pavlovian
dog attuned to the resonating
bell toll of death, salivating at the
thought of impending pity and sadness.

There’s nothing romantic at all about the depres-
sion and anxiety, but my longing for tragedy rears its

ugly head and demands to be satiated. <br><br>
The truth is that I miss the cold, brisk air back home. I miss
those early mornings tinged with frost where every breath is
a cloud of fog, a constant, visible reminder that you are still
alive. I miss absolutely everything about the cold: the frigid
water that punches my gut and sheds the last remnants of
sleep away, the crisp air that burns my nostrils and eases the
flame of anxiety, the stupidly hilarious conversations in the
cold where there’s nothing to do but shuffle your feet and
come up with the next witty joke. Every night, I sit on my
bed in my A/C-less apartment, staring up at the crumbling,
sweating ceiling praying for the blissful cold.<br><br><span id="interview">THREE: 1/14/18</span><br>
<br>It’s the golden hour of the day. The sun streams through
the wispy clouds and the sea salt spray swirls in the breeze,
emanating the perfume of life. My friends and I are sitting
cross-legged on a blue, tattered Islamic prayer mat with a
forest-studded hill on the left and the blinking pier to the
right. In front of us is the gargantuan ocean, undulating like
murky lava languidly meandering across the landscape. It’s
all so perfect. We’re sitting in the same spot on Redondo
Beach that I used to sit with my parents twelve years ago.
The waves of nostalgia mirror the waves of the ocean as I
contemplate how each moment of the past twelve years has
led up to who I am now.<br><br>
Huddled on the beach staring into the distance, I begin
dreaming of my childhood, as if the mist from the sea
had created a translucent veil into the past. I’m
imagining myself running in and out of
the warm, foamy water with the
sun directly beating down
on my sunburnt
neck while
my parents
softly converse
in Mandarin
underneath a
rainbow umbrella.
My sister marshalls
my brother and I
into a scavenging
unit intent on finding
the perfect seashell to
decorate our already
crumbling sandcastle. Those
days were filled with red,
cheesy Dorito fingers and
imploding watermelon cubes
that dribbled sticky juice down our
chins. I always look back on these childhood
memories with fondness. They were times when
I hadn’t yet discovered this insipid plague inside me; when I
could be a regular kid squinting in the sun and digging my
feet into the cold, wet sand.<br><br>
We leave the beach as the sun sets, exploding the sky in
oranges and purples, as if Zeus had thrust gasoline from a
canister and Apollo had lit the flames with his chariot. All
the while, I feel the heaviness that comes with the finality of
youthful innocence and enthusiasm–a funeral march for the

oblivious little child I once was.<br><br>
After the sunset, we drive down to Newport Beach,
watching perfectly lit mansions and quaint restaurants
serving sophisticated dinners at three times the price they
should be. We’re slugging Mango Ciroc in the back of the
car, trying to create the perfect concoction of chemical
toxins that usually signal the start of a great night. But I’m
drinking for a completely different reason tonight. As I feel
the alcohol slide down my throat, I’m hoping that
it rids myself of the gloomy streak etched in
my soul that I think everyone’s noticed
but doesn’t have the courage to
bring to light.<br><br>
Instead of this imaginary
dreamscape of Newport
Beach, we approach
downtown and see
hordes of people
streaming in and out
of bars and late night
taco shops like a
giant carnivorous
slug worming
its way along
the coast,
consuming
everything in
its path. Suddenly, I’m
transported back into that
dystopian vision of LA, oppressively
hot LA, where individuality dies in the
crowd of bodies, leaving a hot, sweaty human
mess. Fearing that terrible memory, I convince my friends
to skip the crowd and head to the pier, which had peeked its
face out of the fog-enshrouded beach. On the pier, the fog is
so dense that we can barely see ten feet in front of us. The
people walking toward us appear as ghostly apparitions,
increasing in detail as they approach. I preferred them as
ghostly apparitions rather than the red-faced, bumbling
drunks they turned out to be. Looking out from the
creaking boardwalk into the vast ocean, I immediately
imagine myself entering an enormously large picture palace
with a blank, ominous screen filling up my entire field of
vision. The fog is so heavy that we can’t accurately place a
horizontal line in our field of vision to establish where the
sea meets the sky, so it looks as if we’ve stumbled in front of a blank screen that extends as far as the eye can see. It’s
hauntingly beautiful and reminds me of that Buddhist truth
that everything is nothing and the mind creates the false
reality we see, like an empty movie screen being illuminated
by our imagination. It’s as if I’m being held by the umbilical
cord of the universe, staring down into a blank void that
traverses the entire surface of the Earth.
<br><br>
Repulsed by the wave of drunkards, we decide to return
from our psychedelic excursion into the pier and hop back
into the car. The cocktail of drugs is wearing off and now
my body and mind are protesting the toxic abuse. That’s
what life is anyways: just a chemical onslaught perfectly
coordinated by the body and evolution. As I sink into the
unconscious void, I imagine myself as a sloshing vessel of
chemicals punished with consciousness, a primordial being
that was never supposed to become sentient.<br><br><br>
