                    God, when I was in the womb, you had given me everything.<br>
                    A pair of eyes, although with astigmatism, chocolate brown and pretty,<br>
                    A pair of ears for dangly earrings and the sound of wind,<br>
                    Ten fingers to feel my heartbeat and yours,<br>
                    A nose to smell my mother’s food and hair,<br>
                    And a mouth to kiss my child goodnight.<br><br>
                    But God, you forgot to give me a blanket, a shield, a layer, a coat of immunity.<br>
                    These eyes are pained by the rays of sunlight and colors of the rainbow.<br>
                    These ears can’t distinguish from voices to music to trees rustling. They all sound like a<br>
                    marching band. Tambourines smashing in my ear.<br>
                    These fingers are restless. Stimulate me! Stimulate me!<br>
                    Why can’t you smell that? Why can’t you understand me?<br>
                    I can’t eat this. This texture.<br><br>
                    Please do not call me spoiled or undisciplined.<br>
                    Trucks are too loud,<br>
                    The sky is too bright,<br>
                    People are too unpredictable,<br>
                    Animals move too quickly.<br>
                    God, the world never works how I need it to.<br>
                    And everyone tells me I never work how the world needs to.
