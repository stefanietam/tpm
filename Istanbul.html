            <div class="story">I don’t remember how many times it has been. Oscillating between two cities has become a pattern

in my life. During one of my flights back to Istanbul,
I remember glancing out the window. It was dark,

pitch dark. But the city glowed, piercing the darkness with tiny lights. I am pretty sure I even saw the

sea in that darkness, little glimpses of waves dancing between flickers of city lights. Looking down

from above felt... It felt so oceanic, a moment Freud
describes as “a sensation of eternity, a feeling as
of something limitless, unbounded.” The grandeur
of Istanbul captivated me. Images of the narrow
streets, the hidden corners ornate with unwanted
buildings and the small markets scattered around
every block flashed through my memory. It was all
there, sucked and stuck inside the black hole that
is Istanbul. It’s tiny and astronomical at the same
time and that is exactly how I feel when I’m in my
hometown.<br><br>I always wanted to escape that same gravity pulling
me. Looking down during those last thirty minutes of
my plane ride though, I think I never will. I have to
admit, my comforting Los Angeles life heartens me. The
abundance of sun with the laid back attitude everyone
seems to internalize makes me want to stay here forever.
Istanbul, on the contrary, breeds stress and anxiety from
the never-ending traffic, the crowdedness and the metropolitan fast life. Every sidewalk is an absurd portrait
of life. Outside an affluent neighbourhood cafe, an old
man sells toilet cleaners. Another man walks alone on
the freeway. It is frustrating, all of these lives meshed
together in this small space, all of them passing by on
their own without any interaction. No order. No time
to think about how you feel. Time just passes by and
every little facet of Istanbul, including its people, passes
through with it.<br><br>
Yet, I will never escape the nebulous charm or the
poetic chaos of Istanbul that I still crave here. It is an
attachment, a familiarity of some sort, that binds me
to it. My memory tricks me into fantasizing about the
city as if I am in control, as if I know every little detail
and every road that surrounds it. Even if I leave for a
very long time, when I return, I’ll still know this place
like the back of my hand. The excitement, the thrill,
the strange, the absurd, all find a home there and stay,
forever orbiting. I am conquered by this intense desire
to be acknowledged and valued by this city at the same
time that I detest it to the point where I want to leave
and move on. Whatever my mind instills in me, I realize
that I have no control over Istanbul, it has a trajectory
of its own.<br><br>
I seem to never find the right words to describe it, even
now, when I am writing this. Probably never will. Not
that good at describing feelings that fill my heart with
nostalgia, wonder and melancholy. The dilemma of existing in two places at once excites and overwhelms me
both at the same time. I lead two different lives in two
different cities with conflicting natures, and I feel like
two different persons. My emotions and thoughts are
in constant flux because so am I, perhaps because I do
not know which one I belong to. I feel the same sense of
comfort and strangeness in both places and I end up a
stranger to myself. The idea of starting new lives in new
cities thrills me, but in the end, I think I will never get
Istanbul out of my system. Not because it’s my home
but because it’ll always be a part of my memory, history
and character. I would like to be okay with that someday. I will let you know when I do.<br><br>
