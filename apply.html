    </div>
    
        <div class="applyBody" id="applyIntro"><br>The Paper Mixtape is a collectively-operated magazine covering arts and culture in Los Angeles. We publish two printed magazines per school year and continuously post on our online outlet. 
<br><br>
TPM is a cooperative first and foremost: We are by our members and for our members. That means that anyone on staff can cover events, use TPM press passes, sell their art at our bazaars, and digitally publish their work throughout the year, just to name a few perks. We ask that everyone attend the majority, if not all of our weekly meetings if they are able to. Additionally, since we are self-made, $$ are tight, so we expect around 5 hrs / issue of your time helping out with sales, bazaars, fundragers, baking, etc. It’s fun- you get to hang out with other cool creative UCLA people! Below are the descriptions of our currently open positions. Also, if you are interested in multiple positions, that is an option- if you think you can handle the commitment. Think you can be an asset to TPM and don’t see a description that quite fits you? We also have an option for that on the application.
